String Comparisons:

[ "$string1" = "$string2" ] - Checks if string1 is equal to string2
[ "$string1" != "$string2" ] - Checks if string1 is not equal to string2
[ -z "$string1" ] - Checks if string1 has a length of zero
Numeric Comparisons:

[ $num1 -eq $num2 ] - Checks if num1 is equal to num2
[ $num1 -ne $num2 ] - Checks if num1 is not equal to num2
[ $num1 -lt $num2 ] - Checks if num1 is less than num2
[ $num1 -le $num2 ] - Checks if num1 is less than or equal to num2
[ $num1 -gt $num2 ] - Checks if num1 is greater than num2
[ $num1 -ge $num2 ] - Checks if num1 is greater than or equal to num2
File Tests:

[ -e $file ] - Checks if file exists
[ -f $file ] - Checks if file is a regular file (not a directory)
[ -d $dir ] - Checks if dir is a directory
[ -r $file ] - Checks if file is readable
[ -w $file ] - Checks if file is writable
